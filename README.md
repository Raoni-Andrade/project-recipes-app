### Credits

It was developed in a team effort and and the goal was to practice React.

With a team of 5 developers, part of the project was developed on pair programming, part was developed on single programming.
My contribution was to code some functionalities like new buttons, redirections and loading a previous started recipe. Files and folders mentioned bellow were developed by the team, all other files and folders were developed by Trybe.
